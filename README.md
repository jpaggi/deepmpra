DeepMPRA

The goal of the DeepMPRA project is to develop tools extracting
every last bit of information from MPRA studies using methodical
quality control measures and deep learning. For the moment, we are
focusing on building predictive models for MPRAs screening
enhancers.

We are currently under development, so please excuse our appearance.
